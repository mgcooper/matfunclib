function yn = isonpath(dirs)
   % ISONPATH     Checks if given directory ison the current MATLAB path.
   %              Accepts cell-arrays of strings.
   %
   % y = ISONPATH(dirs) for string [dirs] checks whether the specified
   % directory is on the MATLAB search path. The output [y] is a logical
   % scalar equal to 'true' when the directory is on the path, 'false'
   % otherwise.
   %
   % In case [dirs] is a cell array of strings, the same check is
   % performed for each entry in [dirs]. In this case, the output [y] is
   % a logical array the same size as [dirs].
   %
   % See also path, pathtool, exist.

   %% Do the work
