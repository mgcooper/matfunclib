converting b/w nad83 and wgs84 is not a projection, it is a datum transformation
datum transformations involve 'seven parameter' transformations
there is a file on the exchange called 'Datum Transformation' function is dt
it accepts these seven parameters
there is a good answer here:
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/133861/converting-between-wgs84-and-nad83
which links to the noaa report saved here
note also the geodetic toolsbox i downleded from the xchange does all of this
