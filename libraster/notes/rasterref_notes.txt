'support' is the spacing of the data. For a gridded raster dataset, the support is the cell size. For a point measurement it is probably best defined as the 'sill'. We need to know the support to deal with zero values. 

if the data is known a priori to be gridded, then we know the grid region that shoudl be zero
if the data have a or to have a certain grd

these are the steps leading up to the strange bounding box geolocation

Rrb             =   bb2R(rbbb,grid_res);
[X,Y]           =   R2grid(Rrb);
[Z,R]           =   rasterfromscatter(x,y,z,cellextentX,cellextentY,'nearest');
[Zclip,Rclip]   =   rasterinterp(Z,R,Rrb,'nearest')
