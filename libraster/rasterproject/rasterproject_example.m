%% Unprojecting a Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
%
% This example shows how to convert a USGS DEM into a regular
% latitude-longitude grid having comparable spatial resolution. U.S.
% Geological Survey (USGS) 30-meter Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are
% regular grids (raster data) that use the UTM coordinate system. Using
% such DEMs in applications may require reprojecting and resampling them.
% You can readily apply the approach show here to projected map coordinate
% systems other than UTM and to other DEMs and most types of regular data
% grids.

%% Step 1: Import the DEM and its Metadata
%
% This example uses a USGS DEM for a quadrangle 7.5-arc-minutes square
% located in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, USA.  The data set is
% stored in the Spatial Data Transfer Standard (STDS) format and is
% located in the folder

fullfile(matlabroot,'toolbox','map','mapdata','sdts');

%%
% This folder is on the MATLAB(R) path if the Mapping Toolbox(TM) is installed,
% so it suffices to refer to the data set by filename alone.

stdsfilename = '9129CATD.ddf';

%%
% You can use the |sdtsinfo| command to obtain basic metadata about the
% DEM.

info = sdtsinfo(stdsfilename)

%%
% and you can use |sdtsdemread| to import the DEM into a 2-D MATLAB array
% (|Z|), along with its referencing matrix (|refmat|), a 3-by-2 matrix that
% maps the row and column subscripts of |Z| to map x and y (UTM "eastings"
% and "northings" in this case).

[Z,refmat] = sdtsdemread(stdsfilename);

%%
% You can convert |refmat| to a map raster reference object, which provides
% a more complete and self-documenting way of encoding spatial referencing
% information.

currentFormat = get(0,'format');
format long g
R = refmatToMapRasterReference(refmat, size(Z))

%% Step 2: Assign a Reference Ellipsoid
%
% The value of

info.HorizontalDatum

%%
% indicates use of the North American Datum of 1927.  The Clarke 1866
% ellipsoid is the standard reference ellipsoid for this datum.

ellipsoidName = 'clarke66';

%%
% You can also check the value of the |HorizontalUnits| field,

mapUnits = info.HorizontalUnits;

%% 
% which indicates that the horizontal coordinates of the DEM are in units
% of meters, and use both pieces of information to construct a
% |referenceEllipsoid|.

clarke66 = referenceEllipsoid(ellipsoidName, mapUnits)


%% Step 3: Determine which UTM Zone to Use and Construct a Map Axes
%
% From the |MapRefSystem| field in the SDTS info structure,

info.MapRefSystem

%%
% you can tell that the DEM is gridded in a Universal Transverse Mercator
% (UTM) coordinate system.
%
% The |ZoneNumber| field

info.ZoneNumber

%%
% indicates which longitudinal UTM zone was used.  The Mapping Toolbox
% |utm| function, however, also requires a latitudinal zone; this is not
% provided in the metadata, but you can derive it from the referencing
% matrix and grid dimensions.
%
% UTM comprises 60 longitudinal zones each spanning 6 degrees of longitude
% and 20 latitudinal zones ranging from 80 degrees South to 84 degrees
% North.  Longitudinal zones are designated by numbers ranging from 1 to
% 60.  Latitudinal zones are designated by letters ranging from C to X
% (omitting I and O).  In a given hemisphere (Southern or Northern), all
% the latitudinal zones occupy a shared coordinate system.  Aside from
% determining the hemisphere, the toolbox merely uses latitudinal zone to
% help set the default map limits.
%
% So, you can start by using the first latitudinal zone in the Northern
% Hemisphere, zone N (for latitudes between zero and 8 degrees North) as a
% provisional zone.

longitudinalZone = sprintf('%d',info.ZoneNumber);
provisionalLatitudinalZone = 'N';
provisionalZone = [longitudinalZone provisionalLatitudinalZone]

%%
% Then, construct a UTM axes based on this provisional zone

figure
axesm('mapprojection','utm','zone',provisionalZone,'geoid',clarke66)
axis off
gridm
mlabel on
plabel on
framem on

%%
% To find the actual zone, you can locate the center of the DEM in UTM
% coordinates,

[M,N] = size(Z);
xCenterIntrinsic = (1 + N)/2;
yCenterIntrinsic = (1 + M)/2;
[xCenter, yCenter] = intrinsicToWorld(R,xCenterIntrinsic,yCenterIntrinsic)

%%
% then convert latitude-longitude, taking advantage of the fact that
% |xCenter| and |yCenter| will be the same in zone 19N as they are into the
% actual zone.

[latCenter, lonCenter] = minvtran(xCenter,yCenter)

%%
% Then, with the |utmzone| function, you can use the latitude-longitude
% coordinates to determine the actual UTM zone for the DEM.

actualZone = utmzone(latCenter,lonCenter)

%%
% Finally, use the result to reset the zone of the axes constructed
% earlier.

setm(gca,'zone',actualZone)

%%
% Note: if you can visually place the approximately location of New
% Hampshire on a world map, then you can confirm this result with the
% |utmzoneui| GUI.
%
%    utmzoneui(actualZone)


%% Step 4: Display the Original DEM on the Map Axes
%
% Use |mapshow| (rather than |geoshow| or |meshm|) to display the DEM on
% the map axes because the data are gridded in map (x-y) coordinates.

mapshow(Z,R,'DisplayType','texturemap')
demcmap(Z)

%%
% The DEM covers such a small part of this map that it may be hard to see
% (look between 44 and 44 degrees North and 72 and 71 degrees West),
% because the map limits are set to cover the entire UTM zone.  You can
% reset them (as well as the map grid and label parameters) to get a closer
% look.

setm(gca,'MapLatLimit',[44.2 44.4],'MapLonLimit',[-71.4 -71.2])
setm(gca,'MLabelLocation',0.05,'MLabelRound',-2)
setm(gca,'PLabelLocation',0.05,'PLabelRound',-2)
setm(gca,'PLineLocation',0.025,'MLineLocation',0.025)

%%
% When it is viewed at this larger scale, narrow wedge-shaped areas of
% uniform color appear along the edge of the grid.  These are places where
% |Z| contains the value NaN, which indicates the absence of actual data.
% By default they receive the first color in the color table, which in this
% case is dark green.  These null-data areas arise because although the DEM
% is gridded in UTM coordinates, its data limits are defined by a
% latitude-longitude quadrangle.  The narrow angle of each wedge
% corresponds to the non-zero "grid declination" of the UTM coordinate
% system in this part of the zone. (Lines of constant x run precisely
% north-south only along the central meridian of the zone.  Elsewhere, they
% follow a slight angle relative to the local meridians.)


%% Step 5: Define the Output Latitude-Longitude Grid
%
% The next step is to define a regularly-spaced set of grid points in
% latitude-longitude that covers the area within the DEM at about
% the same spatial resolution as the original data set.
%
% First, you need to determine how the latitude changes between rows in the
% input DEM (i.e., by moving northward by 30 meters).

rng = info.YResolution;  % In meters, consistent with clarke66
latcrad = deg2rad(latCenter);   % latCenter in radians

% Change in latitude, in degrees
dLat = rad2deg(meridianfwd(latcrad,rng,clarke66) - latcrad)

%%
% The actual spacing can be rounded slightly to define the grid spacing to
% be used for the output (latitude-longitude) grid.

gridSpacing = 1/4000;   % In other words, 4000 samples per degree

%%
% To set the extent of the output (latitude-longitude) grid, start by
% finding the corners of the DEM in UTM map coordinates.
xCorners = R.XWorldLimits([1 1 2 2])'
yCorners = R.YWorldLimits([1 2 2 1])'

%%
% Then convert the corners to latitude-longitude.  Display the
% latitude-longitude corners on the map (via the UTM projection) to check
% that the results are reasonable.

[latCorners, lonCorners] = minvtran(xCorners, yCorners)
hCorners = geoshow(latCorners,lonCorners,'DisplayType','polygon',...
    'FaceColor','none','EdgeColor','red');

%%
% Next, round outward to define an output latitude-longitude quadrangle
% that fully encloses the DEM and aligns with multiples of the grid
% spacing.

latSouth = gridSpacing * floor(min(latCorners)/gridSpacing)
lonWest  = gridSpacing * floor(min(lonCorners)/gridSpacing)
latNorth = gridSpacing * ceil( max(latCorners)/gridSpacing)
lonEast  = gridSpacing * ceil( max(lonCorners)/gridSpacing)

qlatlim = [latSouth latNorth];
qlonlim = [lonWest lonEast];

dlat = 100*gridSpacing;
dlon = 100*gridSpacing;

[latquad, lonquad] = outlinegeoquad(qlatlim, qlonlim, dlat, dlon);

hquad = geoshow(latquad, lonquad, ...
    'DisplayType','polygon','FaceColor','none','EdgeColor','blue');

snapnow;
    
%%
% Finally, construct a geographic raster referencing object for the output
% grid.  It supports transformations between latitude-longitude and the row
% and column subscripts. In this case, use of a world file matrix, W,
% enables exact specification of the grid spacing.

W = [gridSpacing    0              lonWest + gridSpacing/2; ...
     0              gridSpacing    latSouth + gridSpacing/2]

%%
nRows = round((latNorth - latSouth) / gridSpacing)
nCols = round(wrapTo360(lonEast - lonWest) / gridSpacing)

%%
Rlatlon = georasterref(W,[nRows nCols],'cells')

%%
% |Rlatlon| fully defines the number and location of each cell in the
% output grid.

%% Step 6: Map Each Output Grid Point Location to UTM X-Y
%
% Finally, you're ready to make use of the map projection, applying it to
% the location of each point in the output grid.  First compute the
% latitudes and longitudes of those points, stored in 2-D arrays.

[rows,cols] = ndgrid(1:nRows, 1:nCols);
[lat,lon] = intrinsicToGeographic(Rlatlon,cols,rows);

%%
% Then apply the projection to each latitude-longitude pair, arrays of UTM
% x-y locations having the same shape and size as the latitude-longitude
% arrays.

[XI,YI] = mfwdtran(lat,lon);

%%
% At this point, |XI(i,j)| and |YI(i,j)| specify the UTM coordinate of the
% grid point corresponding to the i-th row and j-th column of the output
% grid.


%% Step 7: Resample the Original DEM
%
% The final step is to use the MATLAB |interp2| function to perform
% bilinear resampling.
%
% At this stage, the value of projecting from the latitude-longitude grid
% into the UTM map coordinate system becomes evident: it means that the
% resampling can take place in the regular X-Y grid, making |interp2|
% applicable.  The reverse approach, unprojecting each (X,Y) point into
% latitude-longitude, might seem more intuitive but it would result in an
% irregular array of points to be interpolated -- a much harder task,
% requiring use of the far more costly |griddata| function or some rough
% equivalent.

[rows,cols] = ndgrid(1:M,1:N);
[X,Y] = intrinsicToWorld(R,cols,rows);
method = 'bilinear';
extrapval = NaN;
Zlatlon = interp2(X,Y,Z,XI,YI,method,extrapval);

%%
% View the result in the projected axes using |geoshow|, which will
% re-project it on the fly.  Notice that it fills the blue rectangle, which
% is aligned with lines of latitude and longitude.  (In contrast, the red
% rectangle, which outlines the original DEM, aligns with UTM x and y.)
% Also notice NaN-filled regions along the edges of the grid.  The
% boundaries of these regions appear slightly jagged, at the level of a
% single grid spacing, due to round-off effects during interpolation.
% Move the red quadrilateral and blue quadrangle to the top, to ensure that
% they are not hidden by the raster display.

geoshow(Zlatlon,Rlatlon,'DisplayType','texturemap')
uistack([hCorners hquad],'top')
