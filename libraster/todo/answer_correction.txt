instead of submitting this correction, first fix up rasterref, maybe re-name it rastergridref, consider whether options should be added for 'Postings','Cells','Centroids','Edges', etc., or if that should just be handled in the documentation, and then use these various incorrect answers as an opportunty to market matrasterlib

Use the new function 'georefpostings'. 
'georasterref' will give incorrect spatial referencing because the lat/lon variables in the netcdf filde define the geographic location of the data/measurement, i.e. the posting, whereas 'georasterref' assumes the lat/lon variables define the grid cell edges (as does 'georefcells').
See my answer for details. 


In this case it is necessary to use georefpostings. The data provided in the netcdf file is referenced to lat/lon coordinates that define the geographic location of the data/measurement, i.e. the posting. The functions georasterref and georefcells assume the lat/lon coordinates define the outer edge of the 'grid cells' and will incorrectly calculate the grid cell extent in latitude and longitude and  . Subsequent uses of the R object (for example using ltln2val) will yield incorrect interpolated values). The use of 'georefcells' will produce the same outcome. georefpostings will give the correct spatial reference information. 
The correct method is to use the new functions 

georasterref does not distinguish between data values that are referenced by lat/lon coordinates that correspond to grid cell centroids vs grid cell edges. Matlab refers to these two interpretations as 'Postings' vs 'Cells'. 


construct the R spatial reference object  . Consequently the
