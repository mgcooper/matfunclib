function b = fzero_brent(f, a, b, tol, varargin) %#codegen
%FZERO_BRENT  Find a root of a univariate function within a given interval
%             using Brent's method
%
% x = fzero_brent(f,a,b,t)
% finds x in the interval [a,b] satisfying |x-y| <= t/2 where f(y) = 0.
% f(a) and f(b) must have opposite signs.
%
% ... = fzero_brent(f,lb,ub,t,x,...) passes additional inputs directly
% to f.
%
% This function is compatible with MATLAB's code generation -- so long f is
% similarly compatible. Many root-finding problems can be solved with
% fzero_brent by writing another function which calls fzero_brent inside a
% for loop, and this can be made fast by using code generation on that
% wrapper function. Note that f will only be called with a scalar input as
% its first argument; codegen knows this, and might strip out unnecessary
% code from the function definition underlying f.
% --- Example:
% Simple bisection between bounds of -0.5 and 1.5 would fail to find the
% root. Starting with a guess of .85 and expanding outwards finds a root.
% This example is shown graphically on the MATLAB File Exchange.
%
% c = poly([0 1]); % a polynomial with roots at 0 and 1
% f = @(x) polyval(c,x); % encapsulate extra parameters
% [a,b] = fzero_guess_to_bounds(f, .85, -.5, 1.5);
% root = fzero_brent(f, a, b, .05);
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The interval [A,B] must be a change of sign interval for F.
%    That is, F(A) and F(B) must be of opposite signs.  Then
%    assuming that F is continuous implies the existence of at least
%    one value C between A and B for which F(C) = 0.
%
%    The location of the zero is determined to within an accuracy
%    of 6 * EPS * abs ( C ) + 2 * T, where EPS is the machine epsilon.
