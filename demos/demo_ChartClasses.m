% I used doclink to get the links to the chart containers to reopen:
% doclink = gethelpdoclink;

% NOTE: another way is to google it then save the html

% then i pasted here ... note this is more of a reminder of using gethelpdoclink
% than something I really needed here b/c I can pretty easily find this help
% doc, but had a harder time remembering where the next section demos were
reopenlinks = { ...
   web('https://localhost:31515/static/help/matlab/ref/matlab.graphics.chartcontainer.chartcontainer-class.html','-helpbrowser') ...
   web('https://localhost:31515/static/help/matlab/ref/matlab.ui.componentcontainer.componentcontainer-class.html','-helpbrowser') ...
   web('https://localhost:31515/static/help/matlab/developing-chart-classes.html','-helpbrowser') ...
   };

% % here are the demos I was looking for (this one requires opening in a web browser)
web('https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/65857-chart-development-toolbox')

% and this is the post about them:
