% need to consolidate all the various notes i have taken into one document
% (need it to be on overleaf really but can start here)

% Modest notation:
% E = emissive power [W/m2]
% eta = wavenumber, units cm-1, he uses d\eta where i would use d\lambda
% lambda = wavelength
% nu = frequence
% theta_s = zenith angle
% k = boltzmanns constant (J/K)
% sigma = stefan boltzmann constant (W/m2/K4
% rho = reflectance (=reflectivity for pure surfaces)
% alpha = absorptance (=absorptivity for pure surfaces)
% tau = transmittance (=transmissivity for pure surfaces)
% kappa = absorption coefficient
% s = layer thickness
% example: homogeneous attenuation: tau = e^-(kappa*s)
% if no reflection occurs as with gases: alpha = 1-tau = 1-e^-(kappa*s)
% scattering enters the picture when materials are treated as being
% comprised of small particles:
% tau = e^-((kappa+sigma)*s)
% sigma = scattering coefficient
% beta = alpha + sigma = extinction coefficient
% phi = scattering phase function (probability that a ray from one
% direction will be scattered into another direction at angle theta
% omega = single scattering albedo = sigma/beta
% Omega = solid angle
% x = size parameter = 2*pi*a/lambda, x<<1 = rayleigh, x~1 = mie, x>>1 = GO
% a = effective radius
% subscript b = blackbody value
% I = intensity (W/m2) or W/m2/lambda for spectral
% Q = heat rate (W) (integral of intensity over all solid angles and surface area)
% q = heat flux (W/m2) (integral of intensity over all solid angles)
% m = n - ik = complex refractive index, n = real, k = imaginary
% n = refractive index
% k = absorptive index 
% modest points out that k is sometimes called the extinction coefficient
% G = incident radition (W/m2 i think)
