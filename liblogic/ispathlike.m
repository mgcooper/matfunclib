function TF = ispathlike(STR)
   %ISPATHLIKE Check if STR is consistent with a path string on the current machine
   %
   %  TF = ISPATHLIKE(STR) returns TF true if STR contains the filesep character
   %  AND the USER environment variable
   %
   % Example:
   % TF = ispathlike('C:\Users\file.txt')
   % % returns true on Windows
   %   
   % TF = ispathlike('/home/user/')
   % % returns true on Linux/Mac
   %
   % TF = ispathlike('/home/user/file.txt')
   % % returns true on Linux/Mac
   % 
   % See also: isfullfile, isfullpath

   % Parse inputs
   narginchk(1, 2)
   STR = convertStringsToChars(STR);

   % Does the string contain the filesep
   TF = ismember(filesep, STR) && notempty(fileparts(STR));

   if ispc
      TF = TF && notempty(regexp(fileparts(STR), '^[a-zA-Z]:\\', 'once'));
   else
      TF = TF && startsWith(fileparts(STR), '/');
