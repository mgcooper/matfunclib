function y = nanmean(varargin)
%NANMEAN Compute the sample mean value, ignoring NaNs. 
% 
% This function is a wrapper for built-in function mean with flag 'omitnan'
% i.e., mean(varargin{:}, 'omitnan').
%  
% Y = NANMEAN(X) returns the sample mean of X ignoring NaNs.
% Y = NANMEAN(X, DIM) operates along dimension DIM.
% Y = NANMEAN(X, 'all') uses all values in X.
% Y = NANMEAN(X, VECDIM) operates along dimensions in the vector VECDIM.
% Y = NANMEAN(_, OUTTYPE) specifies the type in which the mean is performed,
%     and the type of Y. Available options are 'double', 'native', and
%     'default'. If OUTTYPE is 'double', Y has class double for any input X. If
%     OUTTYPE is 'native', Y has the same class as X. If OUTTYPE is 'default', Y
%     has the same class as X if X is floating point, otherwise Y has class
%     double. Default option is 'default'.
